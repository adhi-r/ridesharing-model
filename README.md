# Agent Based Ridesharing Model
#### by Adhi Rajaprabhakaran, Katrina Gensterblum, and MacKenzie Dubay.

# About

Our objective for this project was to construct a simulation of ridesharing services such as Uber and Lyft for the purposes of experimentation. It is written in iPython and uses packages such as `numpy` and `matplotlib`. Please check out `ProjectReport.ipynb` to learn about how we constructed this model, what experiments we ran, and what results we got. This was a project for Computational Modeling II (CMSE 202) at MSU.
